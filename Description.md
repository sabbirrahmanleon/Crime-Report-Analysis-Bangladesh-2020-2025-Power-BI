# Crime-Report-Analysis-Bangladesh-2020-2025-Power-BI
This project presents a Crime Report Dashboard built using Power BI, offering an analytical overview of crime trends, law enforcement performance, and recovery rates in Bangladesh from 2020 to 2025. It also provides key insights into total reported cases, recovery trends, crime distribution by type, and regional crime density to assist policymakers and law enforcement agencies in data-driven decision-making.


Objectives:

⏺ Analyze crime trends over time to identify patterns and fluctuations.

⏺ Measure crime recovery rates and assess law enforcement effectiveness.

⏺ Identify high-risk crime categories and their impact on public safety.

⏺ Highlight regions with the highest crime rates for targeted intervention.



Methodology:

✅ Data Cleaning & Preparation – Processed crime records, categorized offenses, and structured recovery data.

✅ DAX & Power Query – Used for creating measures, visualizations, and interactive analytics.

✅ Visual Design – Implemented a dark theme UI with charts, slicers, and filters for intuitive exploration.



Key Insights:

📌 Total Reported Cases: 983,837, averaging 16,128 cases per month.

📌 Recovery Rate: 40.8% (401,752 cases recovered), with 87.27% of recoveries related to smuggling, narcotics, explosives, and arms violations.

📌 Peak Crime Year: 2023 saw the highest spike in reported crimes, followed by fluctuations and a decline in 2025.

📌 Top Crime Categories: Narcotics (350,621 cases) and Woman & Child Repression (101,631 cases) are major concerns.

📌 Most Affected Regions: Dhaka Range (146,646 cases) and Chittagong Range (146,256 cases) report the highest crime levels.

📌 Crime Reduction Trend in 2025: This may indicate improved enforcement or possible data limitations.



Impact & Learnings:

This project strengthened my skills in business intelligence, crime data analytics, and Power BI dashboard design. The findings can be used to support law enforcement 
strategies, policy-making, and resource allocation to improve public safety.
